      <h3>Domestic</h3>
      <p class="text-justify">We are fortunate enough to have a long history of happy and satisfied customers that has resulted in the majority of our domestic work to have come through personal referrals and recommendations. We pride ourselves on our personal and professional approach to ensure that your work is completed to the highest standards with minimal disruption to your daily life - using a Mirka sanding system to keep your house dust-free. We work with a number of local trades and would be happy to provide recommendations for kitchen, bathroom, carpet, electrical and plumbing services.</p>
